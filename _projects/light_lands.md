Machines must be clearly and fully explainable to be socially acceptable. This is because they operate in areas of high societal significance such as health, police, mobility, or education. However, they still lack the transparency that is vital for their adoption. 
In an attempt to explain machines’ behavior, it is natural to look for bio-inspiration originating in humans and living organisms. Even though machine intelligence still can barely compete with human intelligence, this analogy leads to an unreasonable fear of technological singularity.
Before being established, our world has undergone long-term evolution. Observing it through many generations, we still can not explain all mysteries it holds. Since we need machines to complement our society, would it be better to build a new alternative world with clearly defined principles and laws, addressing the current ethical concerns of artificial intelligence?
This project suggest sparking a better understanding of complex ideas in AI through worldbuilding which encourages metaphorical thinking. In line with a new interpretation, it brings with it a transparent and enjoyable way of presenting the current advances in the area.

developing machine learning projects through
building an artificial world
it complements the submission with new visualization tools, which improve clarity, content delivery,
and interactivity. The key point of worldbuilding is to encourage metaphorical thinking, which can
spark a better understanding of complex ideas by associating an unfamiliar idea with one that is
commonplace. This is one of the fastest ways to build practical intuition around machine learning,
addressing the transparency and explainability issues.
