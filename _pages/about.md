I am an Associate Professor at Samara University where I lead multidisciplinary projects at the intersection of electrical and knowledge models to create more <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>explainable</strong>, and <strong>interpretable</strong>  machine learning models. The primary focus of our research group is on modeling mechanisms of evolution of mind and cognitive functions with regards to the Desirable Difficulties  framework in individual and group learning scenarios. This allows for <strong>training on less data</strong> with the right amount of difficulty for <strong>faster learning</strong>.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow at University of Zagreb and Ruđer Bošković Institute where we observe the mechanisms of evolution in terms of ecological models.
