Machine learning, Bio-inspired computing, Life-long learning, Behavioral science, Evolution of mind and cognitive functions

I am an Associate Professor at Samara University where I lead multidisciplinary projects at the intersection of electrical and knowledge models to create more robust and interpretable bio-inspired machine learning models. The primary focus of my research is on modeling mechanisms of evolution of mind and cognitive functions with regards to the Desirable Difficulties  framework in individual and group learning scenarious. This allows for faster models training on less data that involves the right amount of difficulty for learning.  <br>     

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at University of Zagreb and Ruđer Bošković Institute where I adopted and extended the revealed mechanisms of evolution in terms of ecological models to predict drug-target interactions.
